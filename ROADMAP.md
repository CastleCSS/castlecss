# CastleCSS Roadmap
We're currently working hard on making the CastleCSS expansions and improvements.
CastleCSS is made to serve as lightweight basis for tailor made software but we do want to give you the option to install a few modules to make your life easier.

## Modules
We want to release the following modules in the near future:

**Forms**<br />
We just started writing forms from scratch to make them as painless, lightweight and complete as possible.

**Main navigation bar**<br />
Simple header and nagivation for both mobile and desktop

**Accordion**<br />
A quick way to create add an accordion

**Tabs navigation**<br />
Easy way to switch between your content

**Responsive images**<br />
Quick examples and helper classes for HTML5 responsive images

**Labels / Stickers**<br />

**Images in RTE (Rich Text Editors)**<br />


## Completed modules

**Icons (Released 19-12-2016 in [castlecss-icons](https://github.com/CastleCSS/castlecss-icons))** <br />
An easy way to add icons to your site without having to host and add a lot of styling and fonts.

**More friendly alert/notification colors, adding warning color**<br />
(Released 19-12-2016 in [castlecss-core](https://github.com/CastleCSS/castlecss-icons) and [castlecss-notifications](https://github.com/CastleCSS/castlecss-notifications))**
